# Predictive Maintenance for Manufacturing Machinery

This project applies machine learning models to predict machine failure using sensor and maintenance data.

## Files
- `Project.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing the full code
- `sensor_maintenance_data 2.csv` – Dataset used in the project

## How to Run
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (`Project.ipynb`)
2. Make sure the dataset file is in the same folder
3. Run all cells from top to bottom

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- XGBoost

## Notes
This project was developed for the ISE-518 academic course.
